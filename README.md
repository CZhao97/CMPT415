The objective is to measure the uncertainty of malware detection using SWAG, Deep ensemble models and visualize the calibration of confidence by reliability diagrams. Besides, two statistical hypothesis testing approaches, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test and mean maximum discrepancy(MMD), are used to test concept shift between EMBER data 2017 and 2018.
